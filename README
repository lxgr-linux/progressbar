# Usage

This is a python module that can be used to add an pacman like progressbar to a python script.

It can be used by importing 'progressbar'
and calling 'progressbar.progress(i, max, "String")'
i is the step the progressbar should be at
max is the max number of steps, maximum is '999'
"String" is the text, that's displayed before the progressbar.

Look at demo.py to lern more.

# Installation
